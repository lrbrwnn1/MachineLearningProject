Intro to Machine Learning Final Project
Larry Rexel Browning III
Due: December 1, 2017

I used the python library "Surprise" for this project.
Documentation can be found here: http://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

To use the program, simply run it. It will ask for the desired userID, and then a movieID to predict a rating for.
It will then print the r_ui(actual rating) if available, along with est(the estimated rating).
I have included the data file in the project folder, so you shouldn't have to copy/paste anything.
